					<li>Music</li>
						<p>Music is a huge part of my life. When I am able to, there is rarely a time when I am not listening to music. I love Korean Pop (particularily the groups EXO, Got7, Big Bang, VIXX, BTS, and Astro). I also listen to Alternative Rock, and Classic Rock, and the occasional pop song (but I hate Taylor Swift-sorry not sorry). Apart from simply listening to music, I am in my school choir (and have been for the past 3 years), and I have been in two of my high school's musicals (and hopefully the one this year), and four in grade school, and have gone on a trip to Spain with my choir. 
					<li>Art</li>
						<p>Art is another of the things that encompasses a large part of my life and interests. Drawing, painting, some graphic design, and theatrical arts are my forte. I have been in art classes every single year of school since Kindergarten (it was required in grade school, but not in high school), and spend a large portion of my free time doodling on myself, my sketchbooks, and my friends (who generally don't seem to mind). I have been in multiple theatrical productions, both musicals and plays, and am a member of the Thespian Honour Society. 
					<li>Being a Geek</li>
						<p>I also happen to love literally everything sci-fi and fantasy. I've been watching Star Wars since I was definitely way to young to watch Star Wars (oops), Harry Potter was my childhood, I love Star Trek and am knees-deep in the Next Generation series (go Patrick Stewart). I love superheroes (X-Men, Avengers, Batman), and lived in a Batman costume for the entirety of my youth (like two years when I was 4-5) until it ripped. One of my favourite novels is 1984 by George Orwell (super great book, 10/10 would reccomend), and if my nose isn't stuck firmly inside Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter (again), or some other fantasy/sci-fi literary work, it's probably preoccupied with an anime series. Or Sherlock. I love Sherlock (season 4: HURRY UP). 
					<li>Computer Science</li>
						<p>Ever since my first computer class in grade school, I have been obsessed with technology. The job prospects have changed, from graphic design to video game development, but at this point, I would be fine just coding websites. I took an Intro to Web Design class last year (junior year), and am currently coding this website in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Programme at UIC Chicago (Ada Class for the win). I hope to pursue computer science in college and beyond.

				I can't say anything for certain, but I want to study computer science and music in college. And after college, I hope to possibly find a career in music for a short while. I also want to travel as much as possible. Other than that, I try not to perfectly plan anything because even the best-laid plans can fall through.
