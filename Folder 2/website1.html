			</div>
			<div class="panel-body">
			"Understanding" is a word that can be understood in many different ways. You can understand what instructions are telling you to do, or you can understand what a person's body language is telling you that their words aren't. In this case, I want you to think of "understanding" to mean "listening to others' opinions and taking into consideration their life and experiences". So what does that mean? Well, you can take it to mean the same thing as empathy, perhaps. Empathy is defined as "...the feeling that you understand and share another person's experiences and emotions" (<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empathy">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empathy</a>). However, the difference between empathy and understanding is that empathy requires you to share in the experiences of another, while understanding is more along the lines of recognising the similarities and differences of your experiences.

			No matter how good any one person's values, beliefs, or intentions are, or how bad, there will always be an alternative party that believes something different. It is possible for one side of a matter to triumph over the other, which is often the result of argument. However, argument and disagreement are not effective means of ending dissent. Let's have an example: Red Group and Blue Group both think that their respective colours are the best. Since both group thinks themselves superior, they are constantly arguing about which colour, blue or red, really is better. Now let's look at two scenarios of how this could turn out:<br>
			<i>*Please note that this is an example, and not reality*</i><br>
			<b>Scenario 1:</b> Red Group and Blue Group both argue back and forth on the matter for a long while, until Red Group suddenly declares that they will not argue anymore, and that blue is no longer even a colour. Red Group completely erases the colour blue from the world, setting up laws against blue and everything connected to it. Blue Group has no way of opposing them anymore, and is forced to accept that red is the best colour, even though this is against their opinion. <br>
			<b>Scenario 2:</b> Red Group and Blue Group, after a very long and heated argument, finally realise that arguing is not going to solve their problem. They decide to hear both sides out in order to make a more informed decision. In the end, both Blue and Red realise that each colour is great for its own reason, and they declare that all colours are equally the best in their own way. <br>
			These two scenarios show two ways to resolve an argument, but only one of them involves understanding. In this way, we can see that the method using understanding allows for a fair outcome for both sides. That is why understanding is so important.

				<h3 class="panel-title"><a name="how">So, How Do We Practice Understanding?</a></h3>
			</div>
			<div class="panel-body">
			Now that you know what understanding is, and why it is necessary, you must know how to practice it. All the complicated definitions and scenarios might make it seem difficult, but it isn't. If you teach yourself to listen to others and what they have to say, then you have taken the first step. To help you more, follow these steps for the next time you have a matter to resolve:<br>
			<ol>
				<b><li>Listen</li></b>
					<p>Don't just hear what the other party is saying; really listen to them. Try to percieve their feelings and thoughts on the matter, and form an idea of what their side is. Listening doesn't have to be silent, either. Ask for clarification if you are confused. But, most importantly, let the other party know that you are willing to understand their argument. If they feel that you really want to listen, then should be more willing to listen to you in return</p>
				<b><li>State your opinion</li></b>
					<p>When you have fully heard out the argument of the other side, state how you yourself feel. But be careful; you don't want to blame the other party, or try to point fingers. Try using the "I feel___ because ____ happened" rather than saying "You made me feel___". Accusatory speech will set the other party against you again. Also, state your stance calmly. Avoid getting worked up, or raising your voice. If your feel like you can't do this, take a break and come back later. 
				<b><li>Reach an Agreement</li></b>
					<p>Try to compromise with each other, and to reach an agreement that benefits you both. Ensure that everyone is satisfied, and that all sides have been heard out.</p>
			</ol>
			<i>*Note: If your find yourself trying to practice understanding with someone who does not want to understand you, ask them research it themselves before continuing. Understanding your opponent is a sign of respect, but they should respect you as well.</i>
